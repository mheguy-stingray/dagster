# Using Dagster with Google BigQuery

This tutorial focuses on how to store and load Dagster's [software-defined assets (SDAs)](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets) in BigQuery.

By the end of the tutorial, you will:

- Configure a BigQuery I/O manager
- Create a table in BigQuery using a Dagster asset
- Make a BigQuery table available in Dagster
- Load BigQuery tables in downstream assets

This guide focuses on storing and loading Pandas DataFrames in BigQuery. Dagster also supports using PySpark DataFrames with BigQuery. The concepts from this guide apply to working with PySpark DataFrames, and you can learn more about setting up and using the BigQuery I/O manager with PySpark DataFrames in the [reference guide](/integrations/bigquery/reference).

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- **To install the `dagster-gcp` and `dagster-gcp-pandas` libraries**:

  ```shell
  pip install dagster-gcp dagster-gcp-pandas
  ```

- **To gather the following information**:

  - **Google Cloud Project (GCP) project name**: You can find this by logging into GCP and choosing one of the project names listed in the dropdown in the top left corner.

  - **GCP credentials**: You can authenticate with GCP two ways: by following GCP authentication instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc), or by providing credentials directly to the BigQuery I/O manager.

    In this guide, we assume that you have run one of the `gcloud auth` commands or have set `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` as specified in the linked instructions. For more information on providing credentials directly to the BigQuery I/O manager, see [Providing credentials as configuration](/integrations/bigquery/reference#providing-credentials-as-configuration) in the BigQuery reference guide.

---

## Step 1: Configure the BigQuery I/O manager

The BigQuery I/O manager requires some configuration to connect to your Bigquery instance:

- A `project`
- One method of authentication. You can follow the GCP authentication instructions [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc), or see [Providing credentials as configuration](/integrations/bigquery/reference#providing-credentials-as-configuration) in the BigQuery reference guide.

You can also specify a `location` where data should be stored and processed and `dataset` that should hold the created tables. You can also set a `timeout` and number of `retries` when working with Pandas DataFrames.

```python file=/integrations/bigquery/configuration.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
from dagster_gcp_pandas import bigquery_pandas_io_manager

from dagster import Definitions

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[iris_data],
    resources={
        "io_manager": bigquery_pandas_io_manager.configured(
            {
                "project": "my-gcp-project",  # required
                "location": "us-east5",  # optional, defaults to the default location for the project - see https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations for a list of locations
                "dataset": "IRIS",  # optional, defaults to PUBLIC
                "timeout": 15.0,  # optional, defaults to None
            }
        )
    },
)
```

With this configuration, if you materialized an asset called `iris_data`, the BigQuery I/O manager would store the data in the `IRIS.IRIS_DATA` table in the `my-gcp-project` project. The BigQuery instance would be located in `us-east5`.

Finally, in the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object, we assign the <PyObject module="dagster_gcp_pandas" object="bigquery_pandas_io_manager" /> to the `io_manager` key. `io_manager` is a reserved key to set the default I/O manager for your assets.

For more info about each of the configuration values, refer to the <PyObject module="dagster_gcp_pandas" object="bigquery_pandas_io_manager" /> API documentation.

---

## Step 2: Create tables in BigQuery

The BigQuery I/O manager can create and update tables for your Dagster defined assets, but you can also make existing BigQuery tables available to Dagster.

<TabGroup>

<TabItem name="Create tables in BigQuery from Dagster assets">

### Store a Dagster asset as a table in BigQuery

To store data in BigQuery using the BigQuery I/O manager, the definitions of your assets don't need to change. You can tell Dagster to use the BigQuery I/O manager, like in [Step 1: Configure the BigQuery I/O manager](#step-1-configure-the-bigquery-io-manager), and Dagster will handle storing and loading your assets in BigQuery.

```python file=/integrations/bigquery/basic_example.py
import pandas as pd

from dagster import asset


@asset
def iris_data() -> pd.DataFrame:
    return pd.read_csv(
        "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data",
        names=[
            "Sepal length (cm)",
            "Sepal width (cm)",
            "Petal length (cm)",
            "Petal width (cm)",
            "Species",
        ],
    )
```

In this example, we first define our [asset](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets). Here, we are fetching the Iris dataset as a Pandas DataFrame and renaming the columns. The type signature of the function tells the I/O manager what data type it is working with, so it is important to include the return type `pd.DataFrame`.

When Dagster materializes the `iris_data` asset using the configuration from [Step 1: Configure the BigQuery I/O manager](#step-1-configure-the-bigquery-io-manager), the BigQuery I/O manager will create the table `IRIS.IRIS_DATA` if it does not exist and replace the contents of the table with the value returned from the `iris_data` asset.

</TabItem>

<TabItem name="Make existing tables available in Dagster">

### Make an existing table available in Dagster

You may already have tables in BigQuery that you want to make available to other Dagster assets. You can create [source assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#defining-external-asset-dependencies) for these tables. By creating a source asset for the existing table, you tell Dagster how to find the table so it can be fetched for downstream assets.

```python file=/integrations/bigquery/source_asset.py
from dagster import SourceAsset

iris_harvest_data = SourceAsset(key="iris_harvest_data")
```

In this example, we create a <PyObject object="SourceAsset" /> for a pre-existing table - perhaps created by an external data ingestion tool - that contains data about iris harvests. To make the data available to other Dagster assets, we need to tell the BigQuery I/O manager how to find the data.

Since we supply the project and dataset in the I/O manager configuration in [Step 1: Configure the BigQuery I/O manager](#step-1-configure-the-bigquery-io-manager), we only need to provide the table name. We do this with the `key` parameter in `SourceAsset`. When the I/O manager needs to load the `iris_harvest_data` in a downstream asset, it will select the data in the `IRIS.IRIS_HARVEST_DATA` table as a Pandas DataFrame and provide it to the downstream asset.

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

---

## Step 3: Load BigQuery tables in downstream assets

Once you have created an asset or source asset that represents a table in BigQuery, you will likely want to create additional assets that work with the data. Dagster and the BigQuery I/O manager allow you to load the data stored in BigQuery tables into downstream assets.

```python file=/integrations/bigquery/load_downstream.py startafter=start_example endbefore=end_example
import pandas as pd

from dagster import asset

# this example uses the iris_data asset from Step 2


@asset
def iris_cleaned(iris_data: pd.DataFrame):
    return iris_data.dropna().drop_duplicates()
```

In this example, we want to provide the `iris_data` asset from the [Store a Dagster asset as a table in BigQuery](#store-a-dagster-asset-as-a-table-in-bigquery) example to the `iris_cleaned` asset.

In `iris_cleaned`, the `iris_data` parameter tells Dagster that the value for the `iris_data` asset should be provided as input to `iris_cleaned`. If this feels too magical for you, refer to the [docs for explicitly specifying dependencies](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets#defining-explicit-dependencies).

When materializing these assets, Dagster will use the `bigquery_pandas_io_manager` to fetch the `IRIS.IRIS_DATA` as a Pandas DataFrame and pass this DataFrame as the `iris_data` parameter to `iris_cleaned`. When `iris_cleaned` returns a Pandas DataFrame, Dagster will use the `bigquery_pandas_io_manager` to store the DataFrame as the `IRIS.IRIS_CLEANED` table in BigQuery.

## Completed code example

When finished, your code should look like the following:

```python file=/integrations/bigquery/full_example.py
import pandas as pd
from dagster_gcp_pandas import bigquery_pandas_io_manager

from dagster import Definitions, SourceAsset, asset

iris_harvest_data = SourceAsset(key="iris_harvest_data")


@asset
def iris_data() -> pd.DataFrame:
    return pd.read_csv(
        "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data",
        names=[
            "Sepal length (cm)",
            "Sepal width (cm)",
            "Petal length (cm)",
            "Petal width (cm)",
            "Species",
        ],
    )


@asset
def iris_cleaned(iris_data: pd.DataFrame):
    return iris_data.dropna().drop_duplicates()


defs = Definitions(
    assets=[iris_data, iris_harvest_data, iris_cleaned],
    resources={
        "io_manager": bigquery_pandas_io_manager.configured(
            {
                "project": "my-gcp-project",
                "location": "us-east5",
                "dataset": "IRIS",
            }
        )
    },
)
```
